## Description

`r lesson_description`

## Prerequisites
```{r, include = FALSE}
prereqs <- c("how to fold cheese", 
             "how to fold cheesecloth")
prereqs_text <- paste0("* ", prereqs, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("prerequisites", prereqs_text)

prior_course <- "Origami for Cheesemakers 101"
desc::desc_set("priorCourse", prior_course)
```

This lesson assumes you know:

`r prereqs_text`

Such as via `r prior_course`

## Learning Outcomes

```{r, include = FALSE}
learning_outcomes <- c("something", 
                       "something else",
                       "thing 3")
outcomes_text <- paste0("* ", learning_outcomes, collapse = "\n")
desc::desc_set("learningOutcomes", outcomes_text)
```

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

`r outcomes_text`

```{r make cff file, include = FALSE}
cffr::cff_write(keys = list("type" = "lesson"))
```
